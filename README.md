## Description

Duration: 1 Weekend Sprint

- For this weekend challenge I built a movie application!
We are able to see movies that exist in our DB. We are also able to see a detailed view for each individual movie, including genres associated with that movie. We're also able to edit our movie's title and description.

## Database Setup

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`
2. Run the queries from `database.sql` on the `saga_movies_weekend` database.
